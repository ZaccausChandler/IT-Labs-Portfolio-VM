Drive Mapping



Overview

This lab demonstrates how I verified and documented mapped network drives on Windows client machines in a domain environment. The goal was to confirm proper network connectivity and access to shared folders.



Steps Taken



1\. Documented Network Locations

\- Took screenshots of shared network locations.  

\- Recorded the network paths of each shared folder, e.g.: \\\\windows-22\\Share

. Verified Mapped Drives Through CMD

\- Opened \*\*Command Prompt\*\* on client machines.  

\- Used the following command to list mapped drives: net use

\- Confirmed that the mapped drives appeared correctly.



3\. Confirmed Drive Mapping and Access

\- Verified each mapped drive could be accessed through \*\*File Explorer\*\*.  

\- Confirmed read/write permissions matched domain user access rights.  



Screenshots captured for:

\- Network locations and paths  

\- CMD prompt showing `net use` output  

\- File Explorer confirming mapped drive access  



Summary

This lab demonstrates understanding of:

\- Mapping network drives in a Windows domain environment  

\- Verifying network connectivity and shared folder access  

\- Using command-line tools to troubleshoot drive mapping issues
